The in vivo Raman spectral dataset from days -1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 found in folders with
corresponding names are comprised of individual MATLAB Data files. 
These files are named according to mouse ID, left/right hindlimb, and reflection/transmission mode. 

For example the file m2398_L_r.mat means that this file contains the Raman data acquired from mouse 
with ID number 2398 at the left (L) hindlimb, and in reflection mode (r).

Likewise the file m2402_R_t.mat means that this file contains the Raman data acquired from mouse 
with ID number 2402 at the right (R) hindlimb, and in transmission mode (t).

The fiber-optic probe background spectrum is found in the MATLAB Data file: 
probe_spectrum_r_20mW_60s_2acc.mat

Raman spectra of a polystyrene reference sample (Bruker) used to check for spectral drift are
found in each folder corresponding to the different timepoints. These polystyrene spectra are
comprised of MATLAB Data files with the file names polystyrene_50mW_t_5s_2acc.mat and 
polystyrene_50mW_r_5s_2acc.mat for transmission and reflection mode measurements respectively.

All individual Raman spectral MATLAB data files found in the folder In_vivo_Raman_spectroscopy and 
subfolders contain two replicate spectra as vectors in two rows in a data matrix. 
The two replicate spectra allows for the removal of cosmic rays using methods that required two
replicate measurements.
